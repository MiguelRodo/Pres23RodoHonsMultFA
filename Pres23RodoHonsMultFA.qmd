## Introduction to factor analysis (FA)

- Context: $\mathbf{Y} \sim \; ?$
  - Goal: Explain covariance structure of $Y$ in terms of a smaller number of unobserved variables

## Difference between FA and PCA?
  - Context for PCA: $\mathbf{Y}$
  - In PCA, the focus is on simply creating a set of variables that capture the variance in $\mathbf{Y}$ 
  - In FA, we now postulate that the variance in $\mathbf{Y}$ is driven by an underlying set of unobserved variables
  - This difference is formalised by the maths, and we'll see examples of this later

## Take-aways

- Theoretical:
  - Conceptual understanding of factor analysis
     - Simpler formulation
     - Similarities and differences from PCA and multivariate regression
